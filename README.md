This repository is created to track and showcase my progress in mastering Dynamic Programming, one of the most important problem-solving techniques in computer science.

Here, you'll find:

-🧩 Solutions to classic DP problems

-🐍 Python implementations

-☕ Java implementations

-📝 Notes, comments, and optimized approaches

-🛠 Clean and beginner-friendly explanations inside code

Each file generally includes:

-Problem statement (comment)

-Brute-force approach (if applicable)

-Optimized DP solution (tabulation / memoization)

-Time & space complexity

🎯 Goals of This Repository

-Strengthen understanding of recursion → memoization → tabulation

-Build intuition for converting problems into DP states

-Prepare for coding interviews & competitive programming

-Maintain a clean personal archive of DP solutions

📈 Future Additions

-More advanced DP problems

-Visual diagrams for transitions

-Time complexity comparison tables

-LeetCode / Codeforces DP collections

🤝 Contributions

This is primarily a personal practice repo, but:

✔ You can suggest improvements

✔ You can request explanations

✔ Open to collaboration on DP collections
